# Color Tool #

_An analysis and synthetic representation experiment about color relations and proportions in images_

An online tool to analyse color proportions and relations in raster images:

* Web-based, but the analysis is computed locally by JavaScript code.
* taking into account color perception by using colorspaces as YUV or CIE L*u*v*
* Using a pseudo-cartographical representation based on the color circle and proportionnal colored circles, in 2D or 3D.

## Operating principles
* A sampling of the image pixels is done, following the sampling rate provided.
* A K-means segmentation is calculated, on means or medians of the color-corrected values.
* A cartographic representation is drawn, in 2D or 3D.
* Results can be exported as images (png or svg) or as values (csv text file)
